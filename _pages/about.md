I am an undergraduate student at the University of Calgary with an interest in scientific computing, specifically the development and analysis of numerical algorithms for computational mathematics.

Currently, I am focused on programming languages and information theory. In my [projects](/projects), I aim to transform theoretical concepts into practical tools.

Outside of academic pursuits, I work with the embedded systems team at the [University of Calgary Solar Car](https://calgarysolarcar.ca/) and share insights on scientific topics at [The Dirac Dossier]().

I am always looking for collaboration with academic and industry partners. Please feel free to contact me through the provided channels below.
